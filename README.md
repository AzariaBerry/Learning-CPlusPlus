## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - My program for Corner Grocer is written in C++ and serves as an item tracker program. Its design revolves around processing and tracking item frequencies and printing the data to a seperate file. 

## What did you do particularly well?
  - I was able to successfully implements all of the features required for the program

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  - I could further enhance my code by adding other languages such as python, css, and javascript to make a actual application such as, ones seen for grocery stores.


## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - The hardest part for me to write was accessing my other files through c++ and visual studios. I overcame this challenge by asking my professor for help and turns out i was using the wrong version of visual studios. A good tool to add is other coding software and a good support group such as my teachers and friends. 


## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  - After learning python, java, and C++ it seems like many of the languages are relatively similar to the point of understanding but differ in syntax. The knowledge of how the code works and ideaology is heavily transferable to other languages that share similarities.


## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I made this design maintainable by revolving this design around the ItemTracker class, which encapsulates functionality related to processing and tracking item frequencies. I made this design readable and adaptable by using the itemTracker class to hold the functions that make the design process, save, print, and runs. This allows my code to have less expendable lines of code and more adaptable to change.
